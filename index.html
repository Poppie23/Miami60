    <p> Brown bears are brown, right? Well, maybe. They come in all sizes and shades, from a light cream color to almost black. It was once thought that there were 86 different kinds of grizzlies and brown bears in North America alone. Today, scientists agree that there is only one species of brown bear with a lot of variations (or subspecies). </p>
    <p>Brown bears (Ursus arctos) can be distinguished from American black and polar bears by their distinct shoulder hump, dish-shaped face, and long claws.Brown bears, also known as grizzly bears, can be found in many of our national parks. The name grizzly usually refers to bears living inland, away from the coast. While bears of the same species might look similar, everything from their size, coloring, diet, and sleeping patterns depend on the bear’s location. For example, a bear’s diet varies depending on what foods are available during a specific season in a specific region.Brown bears are omnivorous, eating a mixed diet of plants, berries, fish, and small mammals. Brown bears are very intelligent, curious, and skilled at finding food.  So please remember: No matter where you are, don’t feed the bears!</p> 
    
<div>Unlike black bears, brown bears have long, strong claws that they use to dig for food, pick fruits, and catch prey.</div> <img src="./IMG FOLDER/bearandcub.webp" alt="" height="200px" >
<div>Bears who are fed by humans may begin to associate people with food, and this can become dangerous.</div>   <img src="./IMG FOLDER/browncub.jpg" alt="" height="300p">
